# Bitcoin Core configuration file example
# Copy this file to bitcoin.conf to use

# ============================================================================
# Network settings
# ============================================================================
# Mainnet (default)
# Use mainnet for production Bitcoin network
# testnet=1
# Use testnet for testing purposes (testnet3)
# regtest=1
# Use regtest for local development and testing (creates private blockchain)

# ============================================================================
# P2P network settings
# ============================================================================
# Port for P2P network communication
# Default: 8333 for mainnet, 18333 for testnet
# This port must be open for incoming connections if you want to accept peers
#
# IMPORTANT: Changing the port number has the following effects:
# 1. Reduced inbound connections: Most Bitcoin nodes expect peers on port 8333
#    - Other nodes will have difficulty discovering and connecting to your node
#    - You may receive fewer incoming peer connections
#    - Your node may become less discoverable on the network
# 2. Outbound connections still work: Your node can still connect to other nodes
#    - Bitcoin Core will make outgoing connections regardless of your port
#    - You can still sync the blockchain and participate in the network
# 3. Firewall configuration: You must open the custom port in your firewall
#    - Ensure the new port is open in your firewall/router
#    - Update any port forwarding rules if applicable
# 4. Network topology: Non-standard ports may affect network health
#    - The Bitcoin network benefits from nodes accepting incoming connections
#    - Using a non-standard port reduces your contribution to network connectivity
#
# When to change the port:
# - Running multiple Bitcoin nodes on the same machine (use different ports)
# - Port 8333 is blocked by your ISP or firewall and cannot be opened
# - Security through obscurity (not recommended as primary security measure)
#
# Recommendation: Keep the default port (8333) unless you have a specific reason
port=8333

# Enable listening for incoming connections
# Set to 1 to accept incoming peer connections
# Set to 0 to only make outgoing connections (useful for firewalled nodes)
listen=1

# Maximum number of connections to other peers
# Default: 125
# Higher values allow more peers but consume more bandwidth and resources
# Recommended: 125-200 for full nodes, lower for resource-constrained systems
maxconnections=125

# ============================================================================
# RPC settings
# ============================================================================
# Enable JSON-RPC server
# Required for RPC API access (bitcoin-cli, wallet operations, etc.)
server=1

# Bind RPC server to this address
# 0.0.0.0 means listen on all network interfaces
# Use 127.0.0.1 to only allow localhost connections (more secure)
rpcbind=0.0.0.0

# Port for JSON-RPC server
# Default: 8332 for mainnet, 18332 for testnet
# Make sure this port is not exposed to the internet without proper authentication
rpcport=8332

# RPC authentication username
# Required when server=1
# Use a strong, unique username for security
rpcuser=bitcoin

# RPC authentication password
# Required when server=1
# MUST be changed to a strong, secure password
# Use a long, random password (at least 32 characters recommended)
rpcpassword=changeme_secure_password_here

# Allowed IP addresses for RPC access
# Only these IPs can access the RPC interface
# 127.0.0.1 allows only localhost (most secure)
# Use CIDR notation for IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
# If external access is needed (security warning)
# Only uncomment if absolutely necessary and ensure strong password
# rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/24

# ============================================================================
# Performance optimization
# ============================================================================
# Enable transaction index
# Allows querying transactions by txid using getrawtransaction
# Requires significant disk space (~20GB+ additional storage)
# Disable if you don't need transaction lookup by ID
txindex=1

# Database cache size in megabytes
# Default: 450 (MB)
# Higher values improve sync speed and query performance
# Recommended: 4500-8000 MB depending on available RAM
# Minimum: 4 MB, Maximum: 16384 MB (16 GB)
dbcache=4500

# Maximum memory pool size in megabytes
# Default: 300 MB
# Mempool stores unconfirmed transactions
# Higher values allow more pending transactions but use more RAM
# Recommended: 300-1000 MB depending on transaction volume
maxmempool=300

# ============================================================================
# Block filter index (BIP 157)
# ============================================================================
# Enable compact block filter index
# Allows lightweight clients to query blocks efficiently
# Requires additional disk space (~5-10GB)
# Useful for SPV wallets and block explorers
# Disable if you don't need this feature to save disk space
blockfilterindex=1

# ============================================================================
# Log settings
# ============================================================================
# Add timestamps to log output
# Makes debugging and monitoring easier
logtimestamps=1

# Include IP addresses in log output
# Useful for tracking peer connections and debugging network issues
# May include sensitive information, disable if privacy is a concern
logips=1

# ============================================================================
# Data directory
# ============================================================================
# Data directory (automatically set inside Docker)
# Location where blockchain data, wallet files, and configuration are stored
# Default: ~/.bitcoin on Linux/Mac, %APPDATA%\Bitcoin on Windows
# In Docker, this is typically set via volume mounts
# datadir=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin
